     The four chief sources for the concertos of Op. 8 are the print made
in Amsterdam in 1725 by Michel-Charles Le Cene and three incomplete sets
of manuscripts found in Dresden (Germany), Turin (Italy) and Manchester
(England).  A specific listing of the contents of these sources is given
at the end of this document.

==========================
The Amsterdam Print (1725)
==========================

     Like many Dutch prints of Italian music, the published versions of
these works contain many small defects, such as inconsistencies in the
rendering of parts that are musically parallel.  Truly incorrect pitches
are found at a relatively low level, although haphazardly marked accidentals
are numerous.  Rhythmic errors are few.  The instrumental parts are
identified as "Violino principale," "Violino primo," "Violino secondo,"
"Alto viola," and "Organo e Violoncello."  These designations are retained
in three Parisian reprints -- of c.1739, 1743, and 1748 -- all by 
Charles-Nicolas Le Clerc, a violinist turned publisher.

    The more daunting questions that arise from these prints are those of
authority.  Because Op.8 carries a dedication written by Vivaldi, we can
be sure that this publication was sanctioned by the composer.  It seems
unlikely that he saw proof copy, however.  "The Four Seasons" had a
substantial performance history prior to publication and thus the copies
offered for print, even if inadequately proofread, are highly polished
musically.  One exception, however, is the elusive obbligato Violoncello
part of the slow movement of the "Winter" concerto, which is missing from
many modern editions and recordings.  It is incorporated in the Selfridge-
Field critical edition version of this database.  Discrepancies between
parts are widespread, especially in the dynamics and placement of text
elements in "The Four Seasons."

     Many of the remaining works that make up Op. 8 seem not to have had
the benefit of frequent performance.  While some works -- especially No. 5
("The Tempest") and No. 10 ("The Hunt") -- give, like "The Four Seasons,"
evidence of currency in the repertory of the time, other numbers may not
have been performed prior to publication.  In the case of No. 9, for example,
the performed version may have been that for oboe (preserved in manuscript)
rather than that for violin, an adaptation intended to appeal to a broader
market.  Abrupt transitions are occasionally found in some of the other
concertos of this collection and many contain unison ritornellos that amount
to little more than sketches in Vivaldi's autographs.  In the case of No. 11,
manuscript sources suggest either that Vivaldi never settled on a final
version of the work or that he adapted the solo episodes to suit a series
of different violinists.  The work printed by Le Cene may represent a
preliminary selection of draft material.

=======================
The Dresden Manuscripts
=======================

     The manuscript materials preserved in Dresden include scores and parts
(not necessarily for the same works). k The most valuable of these are the
copies made by Johann Georg Pisdendel, a famous violinist of Vivaldi's time,
who visited Venice in 1716.  Pisendel became an important exponent of
Vivaldi's music at the Saxon court in Dresden, where he led the orchestra
from 1730 to 1755.  He was especially noted for his execution of expressive
slow movements.

     In the case of Op. 8, the greatest differences from the Amsterdam
print concern the treatment of the Violino principale and Basso continuo
parts.  In the Violino principale the slures are often longer and differently
articulated from those of the print.  Since the Pisendel manuscripts are
earlier than or contemporary with the print, we must regard them as more
authoritative in these matters.  The Basso continuo tends to be more fully
articulated rhythmically and more clearly differentiated from the
Violoncello than in the Amsterdam print.  Although these differences may
have been influenced by Saxon practice, bowings and many virtuoso details
have been adopted in the Selfridge-Field critical edition.  Continuo
figuration is far more extensive in these manuscripts, and often more
accurate, than in the Amsterdam print.  Fermatas on final notes, which
appear only haphazardly in the print, are ubiquitous in these and the
other manuscript sets.

========================
The Manchester Partbooks
========================

     These partbooks were probably copied in Rome around the time of Vivaldi's
death.  They show many evidences of use and are valuable for their consistency
in the use of slurs and ties.  Many notes that are wrong or ambiguous in the
Amsterdam print are appropriately corrected in the Selfridge-Field edition
according to the Manchester partbooks.  Continuo figuration is fuller and
more accurately placed than in the Amsterdam print.  The sonnet texts for
"The Four Seasons" are not given in these parts, but the letters that link
them with the musical structure are retained.  The placement of labels
varies between parts.  The Viola part is labelled "Violetta."

     Since these manuscripts apparently accommodated Roman performance
practice, their prescriptions -- for example, in the variable instrumentation
of the Basso continuo -- do not necessarily represent Vivaldi's thinking.
Some of the more interpretive changes have not been accepted.  Among the
elements generally rejected are (1) trills or staccatos substituted for
detached legato and martellato markings, and other changes to Vivaldi's
articulation; (2) harmonies changed from minor to major; (3) cadential
tones altered to "complete" Vivaldi'ss harmony, where he has omitted a third
or a fifth; (4) changes of texture in the inner parts; and (5) transpositions
of an octave in the Basso continuo.

==========================
The Turin Autograph Scores
==========================

     Vivaldi's autograph scores in Turin, which constitute the largest
surviving corpus of his music, are extremely valuable.  They provide insight
into both Vivaldi's moethods of composition and his technical solutions to
performance problems.  In these sources the variability of Vivaldi's own
thought on musical construction can be clearly seen.  It is apparent that he
often fashioned his solos and harmonic schemes first and then left the
realization of ritornellos to copyists.  For this reason, the sources do
not always agree on the presence or absence of the ripieno string parts in
interior passages.  vivaldi sometimes substituted new solo episodes (Nos. 7
and 11).  For the printed version of Nos. 9 and 12, the principal instrument
was changed from oboe to violin.  Alternative readings of Nos. 7, 9 and 11
are possible.  Rhythmic detail is often more articulate in Vivaldi's
manuscripts than in the print or other copies.  The rhythmic detail of the
opening motive of No. 10 "The Hunt," offers a striking example.

     In solo episodes some of the Turin manuscripts include position numbers
for certain notes and a wealth of other subtlety in the management of what
was, for its day, a dauntingly difficult repertory for the virtusos.
Vivaldi's method of assisting other performers is rarely reflected in modern
editions; some of his efforts are evident in the Turin sources.
